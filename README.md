## static-react-boilerplate

yet another boilerplate...

Since [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) and [phenomic](https://github.com/MoOx/phenomic) are too opinonated, and mostly geared towards blogs rather than more dynamic pages, I've created this repo to allow myself some more freedom.

The static rendering is based upon the great [static site generator webpack plugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin).

Routing is powered by version 4 of [react-router](https://react-router.now.sh).

There's no support for css built in yet. So feel free to use whatever you please.

The dev experience is mostly inspired by the awesome [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
